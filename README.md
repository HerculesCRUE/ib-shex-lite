## Welcome to ShEx Lite
ShEx Lite is a lightweight version of [ShEx](https://github.com/weso/shex-s) that has as an aim reduce the complexity of the syntax, improve the semactic analisis of the schemas and boost the performance of the validation process.

One of the restrictions of the language is that it represents a subset of ShEx. Therefore any source code developed in shex-lite format will be completly compatible with ShEx implementations. But although it is inspired in those ShEx implementations it is a complete independent language, it has its own syntax, semantics, features, compiler and validation process.

To learn more about the language, visit [shex-lite.org](https://shex-lite.org).

## Contributing to ShEx Lite
Contributions to ShEx Lite are welcomed and encouraged! Please see the [Contributing to ShEx Lite guide](https://shex-lite.org/contributing/).

To be a truly great community, [shex-lite.org](https://shex-lite.org/) needs to welcome developers from all walks of life, with different backgrounds, and with a wide range of experience. A diverse and friendly community will have more great ideas, more unique perspectives, and produce more great code. We will work diligently to make the ShEx Lite community welcoming to everyone.

To give clarity of what is expected of our members, ShEx Lite has adopted the code of conduct defined by the Contributor Covenant. This document is used across many open source communities, and we think it articulates our values well. For more, see the [Code of Conduct](https://shex-lite.org/community/#code-of-conduct).

#### Proposals
In order to keep track of the evolution of ShEx Lite we use a [proposals system](https://github.com/weso/shex-lite/issues) that allows anyone to submit a proposal or see the evolution of ShEx Lite.

### Roadmap
Shex-lite is a project that always maintains a minimum view of one year onwards, in this way we can anticipate different demands from users. Currently our roadmap is hold here [[SLI-0090] üöÄ Long Term Roadmap (LTR)](https://github.com/weso/shex-lite/issues/90).

## Getting Started
These instructions give the most direct path to a working ShEx Lite development environment. To build from source you will need about 2Gb of disk space for sources. Depending on your machine, a clean build can take a few minutes. Naturally, incremental builds are much faster.

### System Requirements
ShEx Lite is developed using scala PL and compiles against the JVM. Therefore all JVM supported systems are currently supported as host development operating system.

#### Scala
The compiler of ShEx Lite is build using scala language, that means that you will need to install [Scala](https://github.com/scala/scala) in order to be able to compile the sources.

> Currently ShEx Lite uses scala 2.13.1.

#### IntelliJ IDEA
We also encourage you to use the IDE [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/es-es/idea/). ShEx Lite was developed using this IDE and already includes some directives in the sbt to ensure that the project is imported and set up correctly.

### Getting Sources for ShEx Lite
First create a directory for all ShEx Lite sources:
```bash
mkdir shex-lite-sources
cd shex-lite-sources
```
Cloning the repository containing the sources:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/weso/shex-lite.git .
```

## Building ShEx Lite
Together with ShEx Lite sources we include a `build-script` that is a high-level build automation tool to allow build the ShEx-Lite compiler as easy as: `scripts/build-script`.

## Testing ShEx Lite
We encourage you to add as much tests as possible and then run the previous existing ones with your new tests. As more tests we can do more confident about its behaviour that we will be. In the folder `test` you will find all resources that might be need.

## Learning More
Be sure to look through the [docs](https://github.com/weso/shex-lite/tree/master/doc) directory for more information about the compiler. In particular, the documents titled [Debugging the ShEx Lite Compiler](doc/DebuggingTheCompiler.bs) and [Continuous Integration for ShEx Lite](doc/ContinuousIntegration.bs) are very helpful to understand before submitting your first PR.

### Building Documentation
To read the compiler documentation, start by installing the [Bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed) documentation generator tool by runing the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed.git
pip install --editable $PWD/bikeshed
bikeshed update
```
Once complete, you can build the ShEx Lite documentation by changing directory into [docs](https://github.com/weso/shex-lite/tree/master/doc) and typing `./scripts/build-doc.sh`. This compiles the `.bs` files in the [docs](https://github.com/weso/shex-lite/tree/master/doc) directory into HTML in the `doc` directory.

Many of the docs are out of date, but you can see some historical design
documents in the `doc` directory.
